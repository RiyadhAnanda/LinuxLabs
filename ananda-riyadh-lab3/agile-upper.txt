WE ARE UNCOVERING BETTER WAYS OF DEVELOPING
SOFTWARE BY DOING IT AND HELPING OTHERS DO IT.
THROUGH THIS WORK WE HAVE COME TO VALUE:

INDIVIDUALS AND INTERACTIONS OVER PROCESSES AND TOOLS
WORKING SOFTWARE OVER COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION
CUSTOMER COLLABORATION OVER CONTRACT NEGOTIATION
RESPONDING TO CHANGE OVER FOLLOWING A PLAN

THAT IS, WHILE THERE IS VALUE IN THE ITEMS ON
THE RIGHT, WE VALUE THE ITEMS ON THE LEFT MORE.
